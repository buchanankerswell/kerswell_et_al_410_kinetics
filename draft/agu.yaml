  The seismic expression of Earth's 410 km discontinuity varies substantially across tectonic settings, from sharp, high-amplitude interfaces to broad, diffuse transitions---patterns that cannot be explained by equilibrium thermodynamics without invoking large-scale thermal and/or compositional heterogeneities in the upper mantle. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the olivine $\Leftrightarrow$ wadsleyite phase transition responsible for the 410 is rate-limited, yet previous numerical studies investigating olivine metastability have not directly evaluated the sensitivity of 410 topography to kinetic and rheological factors. Here we systematically investigate these relationships by coupling an interface-controlled growth model to compressible simulations of mantle plumes and subducting slabs. We vary kinetic parameters across seven orders of magnitude and quantify the resulting 410 displacements and widths. Our results reveal a fundamental asymmetry between hot and cold mantle environments. In plumes, high temperatures produce consistently sharp 410s (2–3 km wide) regardless of kinetic or rheological parameters. In slabs, kinetics exert first-order control on 410 structure and flow dynamics through three distinct regimes: (1) quasi-equilibrium behavior at high reaction rates producing narrow, uplifted 410s and continuous slab penetration; (2) intermediate reaction rates generating progressively broader, deeper 410s with metastable olivine wedges that resist but do not prevent slab descent; and (3) ultra-sluggish reaction rates causing complete slab stagnation with re-sharpened but deeply displaced 410s ($\lesssim$ 100 km). Strength contrasts further modulate these kinetic effects by controlling slab geometry and residence time in the phase transition zone. These findings demonstrate that reaction rates strongly influence 410 structure in subduction zones and establish the 410 as a potential seismological constraint on kinetic processes operating in Earth’s upper mantle, particularly in cold environments where disequilibrium effects are amplified.

  Seismic imaging reveals that Earth's 410 km discontinuity---a boundary in the mantle marking where the mineral olivine transforms into a denser form called wadsleyite---looks very different in different parts of the planet, sometimes appearing as a sharp boundary and other times as a broad, fuzzy zone. While scientists have traditionally explained these variations through temperature and compositional differences, laboratory experiments show that this mineral transformation takes some time to complete, raising the possibility that reaction speed (kinetics) plays an important role. We used computer simulations of rising mantle plumes and descending tectonic slabs to explore how kinetics and rock strength affect the structure of the 410 km discontinuity. Our models reveal a striking difference between hot and cold regions: in hot mantle plumes, the discontinuity remains consistently sharp (2-3 km thick) because high temperatures allow reactions to proceed quickly, but in cold subducting slabs, kinetics becomes critical. Fast reactions produce a narrow, uplifted discontinuity as slabs sink smoothly, moderate reaction rates create broader, deeper discontinuities with wedges of unreacted olivine that slow slab descent, and extremely slow reactions cause slabs to stagnate completely with sharp but deeply depressed discontinuities up to 100 km below their normal depth. These findings suggest that observations of 410 km discontinuity structure, particularly in subduction zones, could provide valuable constraints on how fast mineral reactions occur deep within Earth's mantle.
