# This cookbook illustrates the effect of a thermodynamic driving force on
# the olivine --> wadsleyite phase transition. It features a simplified
# thermal slab, induced by cold material entering the model with a
# prescribed temperature. Due to pressure and a phase transition the
# material compresses and the velocity changes to conserve mass.
